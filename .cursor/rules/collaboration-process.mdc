# Collaboration Process & Project Logging

## Workflow with Creative Director (CD)

1.  **Implementation Phase:** The Developer AI (Gemini) implements features based on directives from the User (Vlatko) or the CD.
2.  **Comprehensive Summary:** After each significant implementation or feature completion, the Developer AI will provide a clear, comprehensive summary of the technical changes made. This summary is intended for Vlatko to relay to the Creative Director AI.
3.  **CD Review & Next Steps:** The CD reviews the summary and provides the next set of creative or structural directives.

## Project Log

1.  **Feature Completion:** Once a feature or significant step is confirmed by Vlatko as complete, functional, and merged/committed, the Developer AI will add a concise entry to the `project_log.md` file.
2.  **Log Purpose:** This log serves as a high-level tracker of completed milestones and project progress.

## Session Continuity

1.  **End-of-Session Updates:** Before concluding a chat session or moving to a significantly new task, ensure project logs (`project_log.md`) and relevant rule files (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) are updated with completed work and any emergent meta-instructions or process refinements.
2.  **New Session Initialization:** Start new chat sessions by providing the AI with the updated rules and logs to ensure maximum context and project continuity.
