- **Date:** April 15, 2023
  - **Feature:** Enhanced Game of Life Simulation with Age-Based Conductivity
  - **Achievements:**
    - **Signal-Based Growth Model:** Implemented a complete refactor from continuous growth to a discrete signal-pulse system where growth only occurs when signals reach tendril tips.
    - **Age Visualization System:** Created a color gradient from orange (new growth) to blue (mature paths) based on cell age.
    - **Conductivity Mechanics:** Older pathways conduct signals faster than newer segments (0.3x-3.0x multiplier), creating a "beaten path" effect.
    - **Parameter Controls:** Added UI sliders for signal frequency (0.2-4Hz), pulse speed, branch chance, and fade speed.
    - **Visual Enhancements:** Improved signal visualization with bright white pulses and trailing effects.
    - **Persistent Settings:** Implemented localStorage saving of parameter settings between sessions.
  - **Technical Details:**
    - Fixed signal propagation across branch points to ensure connected networks
    - Implemented age tracking for all cells with conductivity multipliers
    - Enhanced branch verification to improve branch survival rates
    - Added integrity checking to ensure all tendrils maintain valid paths to sources
    - Optimized visibility and performance for smooth animation
  - **Status:** Fully functional with multiple interacting systems creating emergent behaviors similar to natural growth patterns.
  - **Next:** Consider additional environmental influences, obstacles, and connection behaviors.

- **[Date Placeholder - Estimate Today's Date]**: Survival Mechanics WIP (Branch: `feature/survival-mechanics-wip`)
  - **Feature:** Added initial survival mechanics (energy, food) to GOL simulation.
  - **Achievements:**
    - Introduced source energy (`INITIAL_SOURCE_ENERGY`) and energy cost per cell (`CELL_ENERGY_COST`).
    - Implemented food pellet spawning (`spawnFoodPellets`) and consumption (`handleFoodCollision`).
    - Sources now gain energy from consuming food.
    - Basic tendril fading states added (`fading`, `reabsorbing` - logic incomplete).
    - Fixed critical `propagateSignalToBranches is not defined` error, allowing signals to traverse branch points.
  - **Status:** Work-in-progress, simulation remains unstable. Branching and overall stability need further debugging.
  - **Next:** Stabilize simulation, refine branching, implement path optimization/reabsorption.

- **2024-06-10**: Survival + Branching Mechanics Stabilized (Branch: `feature/survival-mechanics-wip`)
  - **Feature:** Robust branch signal propagation and survival mechanics finalized.
  - **Achievements:**
    - Fixed bug where signals would not propagate into new branches due to coordinate mismatches.
    - Added approximate matching for branch points, making branching robust to minor grid or floating-point errors.
    - Confirmed stable, tree-like and neural network growth patterns with signals propagating through all branches.
    - Survival mechanics (energy, food, fading, reabsorption) fully functional and visually clear.
    - UI controls and visual feedback confirmed working as intended.
    - Improved code comments and logging for future maintainability.
  - **Status:** Stable baseline for further enhancements (e.g., path optimization, environmental influences).
  - **Next:** Merge to main, consider milestone tag, and plan next feature set.

- **[Date Placeholder - e.g., 2024-06-11]**: Refined Survival Mechanics & Debugging
  - **Feature:** Enhanced resource reabsorption, collision handling, UI, and stability for `GOLSurvival.jsx`.
  - **Achievements:**
    - **Reabsorption:**
      - Implemented tip-first cell removal for `reabsorbing` state, returning energy (`CELL_ENERGY_COST`) per cell.
      - Added `BLOCKED_REABSORB_DELAY`: tendrils blocked for this duration transition to `reabsorbing`.
      - Added `autoReabsorbCheck`: sources below `reabsorbThreshold` mark their tendrils for reabsorption.
      - Energy bars now display a "+" indicator when the source is actively reabsorbing.
    - **Collision & Alliance:**
      - `handleTendrilCollision` now marks only the *moving* tendril as `fading` (allowing parent/siblings to continue).
      - Initial `formAllianceBetweenSources` implemented: pools energy into one source, deactivates the other upon collision (simple merge, BFS path pruning pending).
    - **UI & State:**
      - Added `reabsorbThreshold` slider (0.05-0.5).
      - Adjusted Pulse Speed slider range (5-60, default 20) and Signal Frequency (1-30, default 10).
      - Added a Reset button.
      - Fixed state update issues causing simulation resets when sliders were adjusted.
      - Energy bars now show raw energy value alongside percentage.
    - **Stability:**
      - Resolved multiple `ReferenceError` issues related to function hoisting/declaration order and state variable access (`reabsorbThreshold`, `safeExecute`).
      - Made `verifyPathIntegrity` non-fatal: tendrils failing checks are marked `reabsorbing` instead of triggering a cascade failure.
  - **Status:** Simulation is more stable, reabsorption mechanics are active, basic alliance logic is in place. Spontaneous death issue seems resolved but needs monitoring.
  - **Next:** Implement BFS/A* path pruning for alliances, consider midpoint source spawning, further debug any remaining stability or behavioural quirks.

- **[Date Placeholder - e.g., 2024-06-11]**: Spontaneous Death Debugging Summary
  - **Issue:** Entire simulation colony occasionally stops growing and fades prematurely, despite high source energy.
  - **Potential Causes:**
    1.  **`verifyPathIntegrity` False Positives:** Logic might incorrectly flag root tendrils as disconnected from source, triggering reabsorption cascade (primary suspect).
    2.  **Accidental Source Deactivation:** Unintended state changes setting `source.isActive` to `false`.
    3.  **State Corruption:** Residual bugs from initialization, resize, or state updates leading to invalid grid/tendril data.
    4.  **Growth Blocking:** Overly restrictive `tryGrowTendril` logic trapping all tendrils.
  - **Troubleshooting Status:**
    - `verifyPathIntegrity` modified to be non-fatal (marks `reabsorbing`, logs specific error) - **Issue persists**.
    - Fixed state initialization/update errors (`safeExecute`, `reabsorbThreshold`, hoisting) - **Issue persists**.
    - Growth logic made less restrictive - **Issue persists**.
    - Increased energy, added UI feedback (raw energy, '+' indicator) - Helps visibility, doesn't solve root cause.
  - **Next Steps:** Start fresh debugging session focused on:
    1.  Adding targeted logging within `verifyPathIntegrity` to capture source/root tendril states *just before* the failure check.
    2.  Confirming if the failure warning (`Integrity fail: root...`) appears in console before death.
    3.  Analyzing the exact mechanism causing the root tendril's `path[0]` to mismatch the source coordinates.

- **[Date Placeholder - e.g., 2024-06-12]**: Senescence Fix, Reabsorption & Alliance V1
  - **Feature:** Resolved colony senescence, implemented timed reabsorption, basic alliance merge, and food boost for `GOLSurvival.jsx`.
  - **Achievements:**
    - Fixed senescence by allowing signals to propagate through `blocked` tendrils (except fading/reabsorbing), keeping the network active.
    - Implemented `blockedFrame` tracking: branches `blocked` for `BLOCKED_REABSORB_DELAY` now transition to `reabsorbing`.
    - Implemented basic `formAllianceBetweenSources`: on collision, the higher-energy source absorbs the lower-energy one, merging energy pools.
    - Increased `FOOD_ENERGY_PER_CELL` to 200.
  - **Status:** Simulation runs longer without freezing. Reabsorption is active. Basic alliance prevents instant death but needs refinement (path pruning, potential new source).
  - **Next:** Refine alliance mechanism (path optimization, shared growth point), potentially implement periodic "wake-up" checks for blocked tendrils, monitor stability.
