# Project Log: Vlad's Leadership Profile Page

## Milestones

- **[Date Placeholder]**: Initial project setup: Scaffolding React + Vite + Tailwind CSS project structure, configured base theme, fonts, and essential build files.
- **[Date Placeholder]**: Data integration: Created `profileData.js`, implemented dynamic rendering of profile sections (Overview, Traits, Motivations, etc.) using reusable components (`Section`, `TraitCard`, `QuoteBlock`, `DataTable`). Added `PromptBubble` component.
- **[Date Placeholder]**: Build stabilization: Resolved various configuration and dependency issues related to PostCSS, Tailwind CSS versions, and module types. Downgraded React and Tailwind to stable versions.
- **[Date Placeholder]**: Styling & Interaction v1.1: Applied global padding, enhanced `TraitCard`, `QuoteBlock`, `DataTable`, and `Section` styles with hover effects and consistent typography. Refactored `PromptBubble` to be collapsible with an initial hint animation.
- **[Date Placeholder]**: Hero Section Implementation (v1.2): Created `Hero.jsx` component with a dark gradient background, centered title (`DM Serif Display`) and subtitle (`Inter`), including a subtle fade-in animation. Integrated into `App.jsx`.
- **[Date Placeholder]**: Hero Section Refinement (v1.3): Replaced title font with EB Garamond, fine-tuned font weights/styles. Adjusted gradient colors, implemented layered background with animated SVG grain filter and blur overlay. Polished layout spacing, subtitle alignment, and divider style.
- Updated `src/data/profileData.js` with the full, finalized leadership profile text content.
