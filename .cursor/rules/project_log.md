# Project Log: Vlad's Leadership Profile Page

## Milestones

- **[Date Placeholder]**: Initial project setup: Scaffolding React + Vite + Tailwind CSS project structure, configured base theme, fonts, and essential build files.
- **[Date Placeholder]**: Data integration: Created `profileData.js`, implemented dynamic rendering of profile sections (Overview, Traits, Motivations, etc.) using reusable components (`Section`, `TraitCard`, `QuoteBlock`, `DataTable`). Added `PromptBubble` component.
- **[Date Placeholder]**: Build stabilization: Resolved various configuration and dependency issues related to PostCSS, Tailwind CSS versions, and module types. Downgraded React and Tailwind to stable versions.
- **[Date Placeholder]**: Styling & Interaction v1.1: Applied global padding, enhanced `TraitCard`, `QuoteBlock`, `DataTable`, and `Section` styles with hover effects and consistent typography. Refactored `PromptBubble` to be collapsible with an initial hint animation.
- **[Date Placeholder]**: Hero Section Implementation (v1.2): Created `Hero.jsx` component with a dark gradient background, centered title (`DM Serif Display`) and subtitle (`Inter`), including a subtle fade-in animation. Integrated into `App.jsx`.
- **[Date Placeholder]**: Hero Section Refinement (v1.3): Replaced title font with EB Garamond, fine-tuned font weights/styles. Adjusted gradient colors, implemented layered background with animated SVG grain filter and blur overlay. Polished layout spacing, subtitle alignment, and divider style.
- Updated `src/data/profileData.js` with the full, finalized leadership profile text content.
- **[Date Placeholder]**: GitHub Pages Deployment (v1.4): Configured project for GitHub Pages, installed `gh-pages` dependency, updated `package.json` and `vite.config.js`, added remote origin, resolved deployment issues, and successfully deployed the live site to `https://vnicolescu.github.io/`.
- **Date:** April 15, 2023
  - **Feature:** Enhanced Game of Life Simulation with Age-Based Conductivity
  - **Achievements:**
    - **Signal-Based Growth Model:** Implemented a complete refactor from continuous growth to a discrete signal-pulse system where growth only occurs when signals reach tendril tips.
    - **Age Visualization System:** Created a color gradient from orange (new growth) to blue (mature paths) based on cell age.
    - **Conductivity Mechanics:** Older pathways conduct signals faster than newer segments (0.3x-3.0x multiplier), creating a "beaten path" effect.
    - **Parameter Controls:** Added UI sliders for signal frequency (0.2-4Hz), pulse speed, branch chance, and fade speed.
    - **Visual Enhancements:** Improved signal visualization with bright white pulses and trailing effects.
    - **Persistent Settings:** Implemented localStorage saving of parameter settings between sessions.
  - **Technical Details:**
    - Fixed signal propagation across branch points to ensure connected networks
    - Implemented age tracking for all cells with conductivity multipliers
    - Enhanced branch verification to improve branch survival rates
    - Added integrity checking to ensure all tendrils maintain valid paths to sources
    - Optimized visibility and performance for smooth animation
  - **Status:** Fully functional with multiple interacting systems creating emergent behaviors similar to natural growth patterns.
  - **Next:** Consider additional environmental influences, obstacles, and connection behaviors.
